In the hidden fields of his ordering form, the merchant can send 4 URLs (accepturl, exceptionurl, cancelurl and
declineurl) where our system redirects the customer at the end of the payment process:

Field Usage
accepturl URL of the web page to display to the customer when the payment has been
authorized (status 5), accepted (status 9) or is waiting to be accepted (pending,
status 51 or 91).
declineurl URL of the web page to show the customer when the acquirer declines the authorization
(status 2) more than the maximum permissible number of times.
exceptionurl URL of the web page to display to the customer when the payment result is
uncertain (status 52 or 92).
If this field is empty the customer will be displayed the accepturl instead.
cancelurl URL of the web page to display to the customer when he cancels the payment
(status 1).
If this field is empty the declineurl will be displayed to the customer instead.

The merchant can send us two extra parameters in the hidden fields of the order form, in order to retrieve
them as feedback parameter after the payment. The following hidden fields are available:

Field Usage
complus Field for submitting a value you would like returned in the post sale request.
paramplus Field for submitting some parameters and their values you would like returned
in the post sale request.
The field paramplus is not included in the feedback parameters as such; instead,
the parameters/values you submit in this field will be parsed and the
resulting parameters added to the http request.
